<h3>Accepting a word by a Mealy machine </h3>
<p>Main idea: We are given a graph and a set of words. For each word, we need to check if going from a start state and processing a letter at a time we can reach a final state.
If so, we print the path we have taken and the output generated by that word.</p>
